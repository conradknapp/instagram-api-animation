# Instagram API Animation

Having explored the Instagram API and being disappointed in the limited endpoints it offered, I decided to simply pull content from my own Instagram and then add some attractive animations/transitions for showing photo information (something unique that would hold a user's interest). It uses fetch API for getting the data and CSS grid for the responsive layout.
